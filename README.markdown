# LastFM Advanced Charts

LastFM Advanced Charts generates a customizable graph with the accumulated
scrobblings of a given lastfm account using [Google Chart API](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/).

The main purpose of thus library is to play a little bit withlast.fm's API,
and building up graphs and stats that are really helpful for me and I haven't 
found at [build.last.fm](http://build.last.fm) other services...

# Dependencies

This library has some requirements listed above:

- [GChartWrapper](http://code.google.com/p/google-chartwrapper/)
- [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
- [A LastFM API key](http://www.lastfm.es/api)


# Future Plans
- Propper packaging
- Propper documentation
- Tests
- Use [lxml](http://lxml.de/) instead of BeautifulSoup
- Support for more than one band stats per graph
